<h1>Plants & gardening</h1>
<p>
I like plants!  They're wonderfully calming, and interesting to
grow.  Some plants I've tried growing are jalapeño, bell, and
Hungarian wax peppers, spearmint, and rosemary.
</p>

<h2>Hot peppers</h2>
<p>
My adventures in growing hot peppers have generally been varied.
Jalapeños went just fine, producing a reasonable number of fruits
for the climate.  I don't really know what sort of heat they should
have produced, but they seemed to have enough for jalapeños.
</p>
<p>
The bell peppers, while not exactly hot, seemed to be alright.  The
fruits weren't particularly large, and the seeds seemed somewhat
undersized.  I used some of the diced pepper for omelets, and put
the seeds out to dry.
</p>
<p>
The least successful crop was the Hungarian wax peppers, although
I really shouldn't be so harsh given the good flavor.  Some manner
of critter stripped every leaf from both of the plants we had, and
both were only able to produce a single fruit.  Despite that, they
still had good heat and flavor, along with well-developed seeds I
currently have drying out on a windowsill.
</p>
<p>
My hope for the next growing season is to get more of the wax pepper
plants growing, since they're nice and hot without being overwhelmingly
so.  Guides online call for heating pads and grow lights when getting
seedlings started, so I'll be considering that in terms of getting
the plants started for the summer growing season.

<h2>Windowsill growing</h2>
<p>
The two plants I've had potted on my windowsill are spearmint and
rosemary.  The rosemary has worked out better so far, given that
the spearmint didn't take very long before getting overtaken by
thrips.
</p>
<p>
The spearmint has been doing great otherwise.  A reasonable pruning
schedule was enough to induce more runners and much denser, lower
growth than before.  Meanwhile, the rosemary has been doing just
fine.  I've pruned and pinched it once, and it's put off a good
amount of new growth in response.
