<h1>Music & other such concerns</h1>
<p>
I like listening to music!  The most frequent genre would have to
be jazz, although I tend to shift around in terms of which subgenres
and artists I'll focus on.  Some of my favorite artists and groups
are Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, Eric Dolphy, and Herbie
Hancock.
</p>
<h2>Jazz</h2>
<p>
I suppose I just lean towards jazz that lies relatively firmly in
the hard- and post-bop eras, with some exceptions for Hancock's
jazz fusion.  One artist I've been meaning to explore the discography
of is Wayne Shorter, ever since hearing his work on <time>1966</time>'s
<em>The All Seeing Eye</em> and on Miles Davis' <time>1967</time>
<em>Miles Smiles</em>.
</p>
<h2>Ambient & such</h2>
<p>
I've also been dabbling in ambient and early electronic music, i.e.
<em>North Star</em> by Phillip Glass (<time>1977</time>) and
<em>Plantasia</em> by Moog pioneer Mort Garson (<time>1976</time>).
The most comfy album of all has to be the latter, an LP commissioned
by <em>Mother Earth News</em> to be, in their words, <q>warm earth
music for plants... and the people who love them.</q>
</p>
<h3><em>Plantasia</em></h3>
<p>
<em>Plantasia</em> by Mort Garson (Homewood Records, <time>1976</time>)
is a stellar expos&eacute; of the Moog's potential as an instrument.
From the high, warbling notes of the opening title track to the
warm backing bass synths, the album is at once both soothing
relaxation and an inviting experiment in composition.
</p>
<p>
Garson spurns in advance the harsh, digital sound of modern electronic
music, instead crafting playful and soft soundscapes out of Moog
modules.
</p>
<h2>Metal</h2>
<p>
Another genre I like is metal, particularly drone.
</p>
<h2>Noise</h2>
Some of the noise musicians and groups I like:
<ul>
<li>DNA</li>
<li>Melt-Banana</li>
<li>Merzbow</li>
<li>Teenage Jesus &amp; the Jerks</li>
<li>Whitehouse</li>
</ul>
