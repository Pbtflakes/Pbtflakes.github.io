Trains are great!

<h2>Shay locomotives</h2>

<p>
Some of our favorite locomotives are those produced by Lima Iron
Works, based on the patents of Ephraim Shay (1839&ndash;1916).
These Shay locomotives were the most successful of the various
geared locomotive designs.

Shay locomotives feature a side-mounted driveshaft which is turned
by three pistons and cranks.  The driveshaft then turns a bevel
gear which powers the driven axles.<br />

<p>
The drivetrain was modified from the original patent designs by
Lima Iron Works, mainly to feature shorter gearing.  This increased
torque at the wheels, making Shays especially useful for logging
and other fields which required steep ascents.  This tied back to
Ephraim Shay's impetus for developing a novel drive system for steam
locomotives, his dealings in the logging industry.
